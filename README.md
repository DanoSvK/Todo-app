# What I learned

I learned how to create dynamic dark/light themes, how to switch them ith both checkbox and button and how to make app recognize default theme used on the user's PC.
Next I learned howt o use Drag and Drop API and on my way there I also discovered Sortable JS, which I prioritized (but kept my working Drag and Drop API code inside commented).
